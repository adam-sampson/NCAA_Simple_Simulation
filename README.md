Creating a probability distribution of teams to win the NCAA championship using Monte Carlos simulations

## Goals
The goal of this project is to take a list of 2017 probability pairs from the 2018 NCAA Kaggle competition, and to output the probability distribution of teams to win the championship using Monte Carlo simulation. 

Stretch goal is to compare the results of the simulation to the actual outcome of the 2017 season.

Stretch goal 2 is to perform the probability distribution of all stages of the competition.

## Scope
This code will be limited to one set of probabilitis, but should be easily upgradeable to handle other inputs in the format of the kaggle competition. 

This project is NOT about finding the pairwise probabilities of game outcomes. Instead, it is about using simulation to evaluate the likelihood of each team winning the championship based on those pairwise probabilities.
